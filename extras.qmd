# Cox regression

## Outline

-   Introduction of cox regression
-   Two examples of use of cox regression model

## Backgrouds: Cox proportional hazards model

-   Cox regression is a popular regression modeling method used to
    explore the relationship between survival time and covariates.

-   It assumes that the effects of different variables on the outcome
    are constant over time.

    -   "Survival" can refer to the development of a symptom, time to
        relapse after remission, or as a time to death [@Walters2012].

## Cox regression

-   Cox regression model is based on the hazard function $h_x(t)$ with
    covariates at time t given by [@Tibshirani2022-yr]:

-   $h_x(t)=h_0(t)\exp(\beta_1x_1 +\beta_2x_2 + \dots + \beta_p x_p)$
    Where:

-   $h_x(t)$ is the hazard function

-   $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard function

-   $\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots +\beta_p x_p$ represent the linear
    combination of covariates and their coefficient

## Hazard Ratios and Proportional Hazards

-   The hazard function is the probability that an individual will
    experience an event (death) within a certain time interval
    [@Walters2012].

-   If the risk factor is binary, the result can be interpreted as the
    estimated increase in HR in patients with the risk factor vs. those
    without [@Abd_ElHafeez2021].

-   If the risk factor is continuous, the HR is interpreted as an
    increase/decrease in the hazard rate of death due to a 1 unit
    increase in the variable [@Abd_ElHafeez2021].

-   The assumption of a constant relationship between dependent and
    explanatory variables is called proportional hazards
    [@Bellera2010-fq].

## Testing Proportional Hazards

-   Graphical strategies to assess proportionality assumption

    -   Kaplan-Meier Survival Distribution $S(t)$: Plot $S(t)$ as a
        function of survival time for each level covariate.

    -   plot the function $log(-log(S(t)))$ as a function of the log
        survival time (log represent natural log).

    -   Schoenfeld Residuals

## Time-Varying Coefficients

-   Failing to meet the assumption of proportional hazards means that
    the effects between dependent and explanatory variables are not
    constant over time.

-   Time-varying covariates (coefficients) are used when a covariate
    changes over time during the follow-up period [@Zhang2018].

    -   Example: The effect of the size of a patient's tumor on their
        chances of survival.

-   Internal time-varying coefficients are affected by survival status
    and include values that are generated by the subject [@Zhang2018].

    -   A patient's blood pressure levels during a study on
        cardiovascular events.

-   External time-varying coefficients are pre-determined and external
    to the subject under study [@Zhang2018].

    -   Pollen levels during a study on patients with asthma.

## Methods {.smaller}

-   The Cox proportional hazards model was used to model the
    relationship between survival time and different colon cancer
    treatments.

-   The time (in days) until event, i.e, death, was modeled as a
    function of treatment and other variables

-   Variables tested in the model:

    -   Treatment: observation (no treatment), amisole (Lev), or
        amisole + 5-FU
    -   Patient characteristics: age and sex
    -   Tumor characteristics: Colon perforation and obstruction,
        adherence to nearby organs, tumor differentiation, local spread,
        and recurrence

## Cox regression model

-   Cox regression model is based on the hazard function $h_x(t)$ with
    covariates at time t given by [@Tibshirani2022-yr]:

-   $h_x(t)=h_0(t)\exp(\beta_1x_1 +\beta_2x_2 + \dots + \beta_p x_p)$
    Where:

-   $h_x(t)$ is the hazard function

-   $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard function

-   $\beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \dots +\beta_p x_p$ represent the linear
    combination of covariates and their coefficient

## Hazard Ratios

-   The hazards for the observation vs. amisole (Lev), or amisole + 5-FU
    group with covariate values x~1~, x~2~ and, x~3~ are given by:

-   $hx_1(t)=h_0(t)\exp(\beta_1x_1)$ and
    $hx_2(t)=h_0(t)\exp(\beta_2x_2)$, respectively

-   The hazard ratio is expressed as: HR = $hx_2(t)$ / $hx_1(t)$ =
    $\exp[\beta(x_2-x_1)]$
